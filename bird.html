        <h1>Supporting Bird Well-Being</h1>

        <p>Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about
            two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most birds fly, there
            are some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes
            to their relational needs and well-being.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans. A number of root causes may be
            responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or mental), losing its companion,
            or increasingly becoming bored. Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing depression may
            include the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduced appetite</li>
            <li>Becoming increasingly irritable</li>
            <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
            <li>Songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms. Just like many illnesses,
            identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.</p>

                <h2>Emotional Needs</h2>
                <p>Birds are emotionally intelligent and can suffer from depression due to illness, loneliness, or
                    boredom. If you notice symptoms such as reduced appetite, irritability, aggression, or a solemn tone
                    in their song, it could be a sign your bird is struggling. Early intervention is key—talk to your
                    vet if you see any of these signs to help improve your bird's health and happiness.</p>

                <h2>Environment & Interaction</h2>
                <p>Birds need mental stimulation and social time. Provide a variety of toys, safe perches, and
                    opportunities for time outside of the cage. Some birds thrive on companionship, while others prefer
                    more solitude—observe your bird's behavior carefully to understand its needs. Interaction and play
                    are vital to keeping your bird emotionally healthy.</p>
